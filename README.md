ðŸ§  Brainstroke Risk Prediction

Kaggle Dataset

ðŸš€ This repository presents a machine learning-based approach to predicting the risk of stroke. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and the implementation of multiple predictive models.

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before you proceed:

    Numpy and Pandas for data handling and manipulation.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn for generating visualizations.
    Sklearn.preprocessing and Imblearn for scaling data and addressing class imbalance.

Getting Started

To begin working with the stroke prediction pipeline, follow these instructions:

    Clone the project repository:

    bash

git clone https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

Change into the project directory:

bash

    cd stroke-prediction-dataset

    Execute the Jupyter notebook:
    Open the provided notebook to start the analysis and model-building process.
